                To my kambal, we somehow grew up together. I remember the time that I first came here in manila and I didn't know anyone, but then I met you guys. You guys are the reason why somehow I adjusted here. You guys made my life here bearable when I hated living here with mami. I remember I always include you in every vacation or gala that mami planned because I know that wouldn't be fun without you both. Thank you for making my life here less miserable.

                We've witnessed each other's ups and downs; we laughed together, cried together, and even got mad at each other, but all the things that happened, we stayed together. Thank you guys for being a piece of my puzzle; you completed something a part of me. Please know that I'm always here for you. I am proud of all the things that you went through. You guys are the bravest girls Ive met. I hope that growing won't make our friendship change. I love you guys!! Happy 19th Birthday!!
